![BackCase](/img/BackCaseWifi.png)

This is a collection of addon boards for the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) multi-tool in the style of a backpack that clips behind the Flipper!

Right now it features only an ESP32 wifi board, like the official wifi devboard, only formatted as a backpack and with an SD card slot fitted.
As soon as this board is verified (currently in production) protoboards and other addons will be created in the same form factor!

The backpack framework is designed to fit snugly to a Flipper inside its silicone case. Without a silicone sleeve, the board will have 2mm of space around the Flipper, which might be undesireable.

Finished designs will be stocked at Tindie.
The first prototype run will be quite limited but if there is interest in more, a bigger batch will be produced.

## Boards

### Connecting piece

![ConnectingPiece](img/ConnectingPiece.png)

Every board uses the same connector up top. This is what plugs into the Flipper and makes the board an actual backpack.
The addon board and the connecting piece slide into each other and get soldered at the intersection to form a solid, right angle connection.


### ESP32 Wifi Dev board

![Wifi](img/Wifi.png)

Very similar to the official Wifi dev board. Additionally includes a micro SD card slot so you don't have to mod the official board yourself. Currently in production - to be verified.
