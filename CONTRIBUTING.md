# Contributing

I would be very happy to accept your contributions to this repository in the form of merge requests. Please make sure to follow the following few guidelines for easier merging.

## Merge Requests

1. For large changes, open up an issue first to see if someone is already working on it.
2. Make sure to always open merge requests from a new branch and not from your forks master branch.
3. You mustn't count up any version numbers in your changes.
4. If a specific version of a tool (KiCad / FreeCAD build version etc.) is specified in the repo, try using the same version as well, as I might not be able to merge and/or look at your changes if you are using a more recent version of a tool than myself.
5. For PCBs containing commit hashes on board, I will only update them for official releases right before generating gerbers. If you create gerbers of your own unmerged branch, update the commit hash to the most recent one as well and maybe add information about your board coming from a fork.
